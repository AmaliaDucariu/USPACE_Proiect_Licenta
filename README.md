It is based on ArcGIS API, so in order to run it, the user will need an API key. Follow the instructions presented in the following link to get the API key.
https://developers.arcgis.com/documentation/mapping-apis-and-services/security/tutorials/create-and-manage-an-api-key/

Once the key is generated, the user has to replace it in com/app/ApiKey.java

The "User Perspective" Menu is linked to a local MySQL database. The features of the menu are available only if the user creates his own database.
